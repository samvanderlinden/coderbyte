This challenge requires you to reverse an input string. A string in programming is sequence of characters and a character is simply a symbol that you can enter for the computer to read, such as a,b,z,$,4,? etc. An example of a string may be: "Hello" or "abc123$??." Strings always need to be written between double or single quotes (" or ').
